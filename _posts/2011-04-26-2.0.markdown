-   Folding now works correctly. Folds will be preserved when leaving the
    Tagbar window and when switching between files. Also tag types can be
    configured to be folded by default, which is useful for things like
    includes and imports.
-   DoctorJS/jsctags and other compatible programs are now supported.
-   All of the highlight groups can now be overridden.
-   Added keybinding to quickly jump to next/previous top-level tag.
-   Added Taglist's "p" keybinding for jumping to a tag without leaving the
    Tagbar window.
-   Several bugfixes and other small improvements.

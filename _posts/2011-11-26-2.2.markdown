title: 2.2

- Small incompatible change: TagbarOpen now doesn't jump to the Tagbar window
  anymore if it is already open. Use "TagbarOpen j" instead or see its
  documentation for more options.
- Tags inside of scopes now have a header displaying their "kind".
- The Tagbar contents are now immediately updated on save for files smaller
  than a configurable size.
- Tagbar can now be configured to jump to a tag with only a single-click
  instead of a double-click.
- Most of the script has been moved to the autoload directory, so Vim startup
  should be faster (thanks to Kien N).
- Jumping to tags should work most of the time even if the file has been
  modified and not saved.
- If Ctags has been installed into the default location using Homebrew or
  MacPorts it should now be found automatically.
- Several bugfixes.

title: 2.4.1

- Fixed some bugs related to the currenttag() function when it was called
  before the rest of the plugin was loaded. Also fail silently in case
  something goes wrong so the statusline doesn't get messed up.
- In certain cases highlighting tags in deeply nested folds could cause an
  error message.
- Spellchecking is now correctly getting disabled in the Tagbar window.

-   Type definitions can now include a path to a file with the ctags
    definition. This is especially useful for ftplugins that can now ship with
    a complete ctags and Tagbar configuration without requiring user
    intervention. Thanks to Jan Christoph Ebersbach for the suggestion.
-   Added autofocus setting by Taybin Rutkin. This will put the cursor in the
    Tagbar window when it is opened.
-   The "scopes" field is no longer needed in type definitions, the
    information is already there in "scope2kind". Existing definitions will be
    ignored.
-   Some fixes and improvements related to redrawing and window switching.

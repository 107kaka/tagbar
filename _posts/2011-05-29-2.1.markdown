-   Make Tagbar work in (hopefully) all cases under Windows
-   Handle cases where 'encoding' is different from system encoding, for
    example on a Chinese Windows with 'encoding' set to "utf-8" (see manual
    for details in case it doesn't work out-of-the-box)
-   Fixed a bug with the handling of subtypes like "python.django"
-   If a session got saved with Tagbar open it now gets restored properly
-   Locally reset foldmethod/foldexpr in case foldexpr got set to something
    expensive globally
-   Tagbar now tries hard to go to the correct window when jumping to a tag
-   Explain some possible issues with the current jsctags version in the
    manual
-   Explicitly check for some possible configuration problems to be able to
    give better feedback
-   A few other small fixes

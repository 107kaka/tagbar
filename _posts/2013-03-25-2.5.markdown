- New command :TagbarTogglePause to freeze Tagbar in its current state so you
  can switch to other files while keeping the old information displayed for
  reference. (Kian Ryan)
- New command :TagbarCurrentTag which reports the same information as
  currenttag().
- New option tagbar_indent to configure the indentation depth of the tags.
- New option tagbar_show_visibility to allow disabling the visibility symbols.
- Files are now cached locally to avoid additional slowdowns for slow
  connections. This also makes it possible to use Tagbar with files accessed
  through Netrw.
- Execute ctags again even if the previous run reported errors, in case it was
  a parse error that has since been fixed. If the error persists, don't
  display it again.
- Improved window switching and Vim exit behaviours. (Techlive Zheng)
- The currenttag() function now can show the prototype instead of the actual
  tag, which can be useful in some cases where ctags doesn't report all the
  interesting information.
- The prototype shown in the tooltip or command line should now always be
  complete, even if it is spread out over more than one line in the source
  file.
- The TagbarAccessPublic etc. highlight groups have been renamed to
  TagbarVisibilityPublic etc. to keep them in line with standard terminology.
  The old names are still supported.
- Various smaller improvements and bugfixes.

- Add a convenience function that allows more flexible ways to automatically
  open Tagbar.
- Replace option tagbar_usearrows with tagbar_iconchars to allow custom
  characters to be specified. This helps with fonts that don't display the
  default characters properly.
- Remove the need to provide the complete jsctags configuration if jsctags is
  not found in $PATH, now only the concrete path has to be specified.
- Add debugging functionality.
